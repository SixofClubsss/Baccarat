# Baccarat
On chain Baccarat.

Written in Go and using [Fyne Toolkit](https://fyne.io/), Baccarat is built on Dero's private L1. Powered by [Gnomon](https://github.com/civilware/Gnomon) and [dReams](https://github.com/dReam-dApps/dReams), it is closely modeled after the real world game of Baccarat. The tables are each individually owned and operated. Cards and betting are handled on chain in a verifiable manner and your account balances remain private while playing.
